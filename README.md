# WindSurf Configuration

WindSurf is a powerful agentic AI coding assistant designed by the Windsurf engineering team. This repository contains configuration rules and settings that customize the behavior of the WindSurf AI assistant.

## üöÄ Features

- Custom rules and configurations for WindSurf AI
- Multi-language support (Go, Python)
- Django project templates and best practices
- Modern UI/UX guidelines with dark theme
- HTMX integration patterns

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- A working installation of WindSurf AI
- Basic understanding of YAML configuration files
- For Python/Django projects:
  - Python 3.10+
  - Django
  - pip (Python package manager)
- For Go projects:
  - Go 1.18+

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Place the `.windsurfrc` file in your home directory:
   ```bash
   # Create the config directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ~/.config/windsurf/
   
   # Copy the configuration file
   cp rules/go/.windsurfrc ~/.config/windsurf/config.yaml
   ```

2. Reload WindSurf to apply the new rules:
   - If using the IDE integration, restart your IDE
   - If using the CLI, restart your terminal session
   - Some configurations may require a full system restart to take effect

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

After installation, WindSurf will automatically use the configuration from `~/.config/windsurf/config.yaml`. You can modify this file to customize WindSurf's behavior according to your preferences.

To verify your configuration is being loaded, you can check the WindSurf logs for any configuration-related messages.

## üîß Configuration

### Python/Django Configuration
For Python and Django development, we provide comprehensive rules and best practices in [rules/python/.windsurfrules](rules/python/.windsurfrules) that include:

- **Project Setup**:
  - Python 3.10+ with virtual environment support
  - Django project structure and best practices
  - Security middleware and CSRF protection

- **Development Tools**:
  - Code formatting with Black (88 char line length)
  - Linting with Flake8
  - HTMX integration (preferred over JavaScript)

- **UI/UX Standards**:
  - Dark theme with gradient backgrounds
  - Modern CSS with rounded corners
  - Minimal JavaScript usage

### Go Configuration
For Go development rules and configuration, refer to [rules/go/.windsurfrc](rules/go/.windsurfrc).

### Global Configuration
The main configuration file is located at `~/.config/windsurf/config.yaml` and controls WindSurf's behavior including:
- Code style preferences
- Language-specific rules
- Custom commands and shortcuts
- Integration settings
